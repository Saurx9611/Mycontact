## ✨ Features

* **View Contacts:** See all your contacts in a clean, responsive card grid.
* **Add Contact:** A simple, two-column form to add new contacts (first name, last name, phone, and email).
* **Search/Filter:** Instantly filter your contacts by name using the real-time search bar.
* **Delete Contact:** Remove any contact with a one-click "Delete" button.
* **Favorite:** Mark (and unmark) your most important contacts with a star icon.
* **Persistent Storage:** Your contact list is automatically saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so your data is still there when you close the tab and return.
